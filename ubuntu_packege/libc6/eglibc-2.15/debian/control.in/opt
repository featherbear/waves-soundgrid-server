Priority: extra
Pre-Depends: libc6 (= ${binary:Version})
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Embedded GNU C Library: Shared libraries [v9v optimized]
 Contains the standard libraries that are used by nearly all programs on
 the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C
 library and the standard math library, as well as many others.

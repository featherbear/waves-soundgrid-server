* debian/patches/series: disable alpha/*, hppa/*, hurd-i386/*, m68k/*, mips/*,
  s390/*, sh4/* patches as they don't apply to Ubuntu and require updates when
  moving to new upstream versions.

* Disable patch i386/local-pthread_cond_wait.diff, probably because it disables
  assembly routines for pthread_cond_wait and might have a performance impact.

* Disable patches any/local-gai-rfc1918-scope-global.patch,

  build.
